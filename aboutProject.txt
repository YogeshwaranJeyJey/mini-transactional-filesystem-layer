MINI TRANSACTIONAL FILESYSTEM LAYER

    This project aims to build a mini transactional file system layer supporting atomic writes using WAL or Journaling and recovery logic.
This layer sits on top of a normal text file and ensures that,
1. No partial writes occur
2. Crashes do not corrupt file.
3. All operations are atomic.
4. Recovery of the file when the crash occurs to maintain consistency

Core Concept:
Before modifying the data file, the intended changes have to be written on a WAL or a Journal file. Only if the WAL or Journal file is safely written the changes are updated to the data file.
If a crash occurs, the system uses this WAL or Journal file to Redo the committed changes or undo the incomplete changes.

Data file:
The data file contains the account details of a bank’s customers.
Account No
Name
Account Balance
Mobile No
Email Id

Components:
1.Transaction Manager
    Handles all the transaction related operations like write, update, commit, abort etc…
2.WAL or Journaling
    Stores the Transaction ID, which account is being modified, old values, New Values and the commit status.
3.Atomic Write Logic
    Ensures the real data file is updated only after the journal entry is safely written.
4.Crash Recovery Module
    Handles the crash recovery process.
5.File Read/Write Layer
Provides APIs for reading account data and updating account records.
